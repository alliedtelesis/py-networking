Py-Networking (PN) is a python library that provides a new way to interact and configure your networking devices.
PN abstract the physical device and provides to the user an uniform API that does not depends from the specific device configuration or configuration syntax.
PN does not emulate features that device maybe missing but if two different devices implement a specific feature, this is exposed to the user in the same way.
